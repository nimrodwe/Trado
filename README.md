TRADO â€“ Specification

TRADO developed marketplace platform is unique in its entirety and the scope of
the solution it provides to users - retailers / buyers and suppliers / sellers. Unlike
existing trading platforms in the B2B market that produce a relationship between
suppliers and buyers, the platform is developed to produce an anonymous
market. A market where the details of sellers and buyers are known to the system
only and are not visible. In order to enable trade and transfer of goods in an
anonymous environment, the system provides, in addition to the market
environment component, a component that handles the transportation of the
goods, as well as a component for providing advanced credit solutions.
The system provides management tools, decision making, tracking and alerts
when it relies on user behavior data, contact with users&#39; purchasing and inventory
systems, contact with moving systems, contact external systems for information
to assess the capabilities of the buyer seeking financial assistance and more. The
development is innovative and challenging.
